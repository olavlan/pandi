[Pandoc filters](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) in Gleam.

Pandoc allows you to work with documents in a format-independent way. 

This package's goal is to make it easy to work with Pandoc documents:

```gleam
{{examples/src/examples/increase_header_level.gleam}}
```

Note that the package only works with Pandoc's JSON output, so your application will need to call ´pandoc´ in order to work with various document formats:

```gleam
{{examples/src/examples/pandoc.gleam}}
```
